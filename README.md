Based on the insights: Mobiles and tablets category, recorded the highest order with over 60,000 orders, which is about 21% of company's entire orders, while books category had the least order of about 0.28%. Texas, California,and New York are the states with the highest Customer Orders, while the states with the least orders include Rhode Island, Delaware and New Hampshire state. The percentage of transaction from the south is about 36.6%, followed by Midwest 26.7%, while the least is from the West 16.9%. The disparity between the female and male customers is not much, with 48% of them being Female and 51% of them being male.The company recorded its highest frequency of order in the month of December of over 81,000, followed by the month of April which recorded over 41,000 and least month is October. The great disparity in the frequency of order between December and other months may be due to the Christmas Celebration which comes up in the month of December.

Over one-third of the payment method comes from Cash on delivery, and only a very few of the customers use cash at doorstep and financial settlement method. Over 50% of the customers(newbie) started shopping with the company about 10years ago, while only less than 5% of the customers still place orders from the company for the pass 39years. Winter Season records the highest customers, about 38.4% followed by Spring, this correlated with the high orders seen in the month of December. 2016 and 2015 year of signup, recorded the highest total amount generated by the company. 2016 and 2015 also recorded the year with the highest quantity of items bought by customer.

Mobile phones and tablets accounts for almost 80% of the total amount generated in the data set; this is despite significant quantity purchases in other categories such as; Applicances, Beauty and Grooming, Superstore, Mens fashion and others. The ratio of items purchased to total amount generated in each category should be analysed. For example the Superstore category has an adequate quantity purchase of almost 100,000 however the amount generated from these purchases is less than 20,000 dollars. Since there is disparity in terms of quantity purchased and value generated, Sterling E-commerce should seek efficent means in generating value from other categories, for example black friday sales, promos, holiday theme sales e.t.c.

Customer who order via easypay-vouchers do not contribute to quantity ordered, however the total amount generated from this payment method is highly significant. While the opposite applies to the COD method of payment; high contribution in terms of quantity but not in terms of total amount generated. This payment methods can be used to analyse the purchasing power of the type of customers who use such payment methods. The dataset shows that during the winter period, the quantity order is high however the amount generated was low for that season. Sterling E-commence need to investigate why there is a disparity between quantity ordered and revenue generated in winter.
